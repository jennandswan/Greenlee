         <h2 class="phead">JavaScript Basics</h2>
         <p class="phead">JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely
            popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for
            developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web
            browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic
            control over them.</p>
         <ul class="info">
            <li><u class="lightblue">Variable Declaration</u> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data
               values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All
               JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers.<a
                  class="purple"> var x;</a></li>

            <li><u class="lightblue">Variable Assignment</u> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables
               - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment
               operator assigns a value to a variable.<a class="purple"> var x = 10;</a></li>

            <li><u class="lightblue">Data Types</u> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on
               variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives:
               Boolean - <a class="purple">true</a> or <a class="purple">false;</a> null - <a class="purple">null</a>
               aka nothing; Number - <a class="purple"> 42</a> or <a class="purple">3.14159;</a> String - <a
                  class="purple">"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</a> Array - <a class="purple">[1,'Coding',2'Dojo';</a> and Object
               - <a class="purple">{first_name:'Jane',last_name:'Doe'}</a></li>

            <li><u class="lightblue"> Conditionals</u> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for
               different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You
               can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional
               statements:<a class="purple"> if</a> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <a
                  class="purple">else if </a>to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <a
                  class="purple">else </a>we execute this block of code;</li>

            <li><u class="lightblue">Loops</u> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language,
               but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you
               have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. That's a loop!</li>

            <li><u class="lightblue">Function</u> Functions are anencapsulation of a code block. When we call our
               function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we
               are putting together a desk fro Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw
               the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions.
               Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.</li>
