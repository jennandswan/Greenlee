            <h2 align=center>Beer History</h2>

            Ancient History Historians speculate that prehistoric nomads may have made beer from grain & water before learning to make bread. Beer became ingrained in the culture of civilizations with no significant viticulture. Noah's provisions included beer on
            the Ark. 4300 BC, Babylonian clay tablets detail recipes for beer. Beer was a vital part of civilization and the Babylonian, Assyrian, Egyptian, Hebrew, Chinese, and Inca cultures. Babylonians produced beer in large quantities with around 20 varieties.
            Beer at this time was so valued that it was sometimes used to pay workers as part of their daily wages. Early cultures often drank beer through straws to avoid grain hulls left in the beverage. Egyptians brewed beer commercially for use by royalty
            served in gold goblets, medical purposes, and as a necessity to be included in burial provisions for the journey to the hereafter.
             <ol>Different grains were used in different cultures:<li> Africa used millet, maize and cassava.</li><li> North America used persimmon
            although agave was used in Mexico.</li><li> South America used corn although sweet potatoes were used in Brazil.</li><li> Japan used rice to make sake.</li> <li> China used wheat to make samshu.</li><li> Other Asian cultures used sorghum.</li> <li> Russians used rye to make quass
            or kvass.</li><li> Egyptians used barley and may have cultivated it strictly for brewing as it made poor bread.</li></ol>
        
            1600 BC Egyptian texts contain 100 medical prescriptions calling for beer. If an Egyptian gentleman offered a lady a sip of his beer they were
            betrothed. Early brewers used herbals like balsam, hay, dandelion, mint, and wormwood seeds, horehound juice, and even crab claws & oyster shells for flavorings. Romans brewed "cerevisia" (Ceres the goddess of agriculture & vis meaning strength in
            Latin). 55 BC Roman legions introduce beer to Northern Europe. 49 BC Caesar toasted his troops after crossing the Rubicon, which began the Roman Civil War. Before the Middle Ages brewing was left to women to make since it was considered a food as
            well as celebration drink. 23 BC Chinese brewed beer called "kiu" 500-1000 AD the first half of the Middle Ages, brewing begins to be practiced in Europe, shifting from family tradition to centralized production in monasteries and convents (hospitality
            for traveling pilgrims). During Medieval times beer was used for tithing, trading, payment and taxing. 1000 AD hops begins to be used in the brewing process. 1200 AD beer making is firmly established as a commercial enterprise in Germany, Austria,
            and England. a) German's preferred cold temperature lagers (bottom-fermentation) stored in caves in the Alps. b) English preferred mild temperature ales (top-fermentation) stored in cellars. 1295 King Wenceslas grants Pilsen Bohemia brewing rights

            this time were exactly the same as those used in bread. Modern History Before the 1800's most beer was really "Ale." 1810 Munich establishes Oktoberfest as an official celebration. 1830's Bavarians Gabriel Sedlmayr of Munich and Anton Dreher of Vienna
            developed the lager method of beer production. 1842 the first golden lager is produced in Pilsen, Bohemia. In the mid-19th Century (1850's) German immigrant brewers introduced cold maturation lagers to the US (Anheuser-Busch, Miller, Coors, Stroh,
            Schlitz, and Pabst roots begin here). The modern era of brewing in the US began in the late 1800's with commercial refrigeration (1860), automatic bottling, pasteurization (1876), and railroad distribution. 1870's Adolphus Busch pioneers the use of
            double-walled railcars, a network of icehouses to make Budweiser the first national brand. 1876 Pasteur unraveled the secrets of yeast in the fermentation process, and he also developed pasteurization to stabilize beers 22 years before the process
